      <description>Intro If you want to make more sales on your website, one of the key things to focus on is easy navigation. Your potential customers should be able to find what they&amp;rsquo;re looking for quickly and easily, without getting frustrated.
There are a few different ways to make sure your website is easy to navigate. First, make sure your menus are clear and organized. Second, use drop-down menus or other tools to help visitors drill down to the specific information they&amp;rsquo;re looking for.</description>

      <title>Using UX Design to Increase Conversions</title>

      <description>When someone comes to your website, they may have a variety of intentions. Your goal is to anticipate what that might be in order to provide them with the best possible experience. Then you must deliver it, and fast. Online attention spans are short, if not gone entirely. If visitors aren&amp;rsquo;t ecstatic right away, they&amp;rsquo;ll go somewhere else online.
Once you&amp;rsquo;ve lost a client, it&amp;rsquo;s difficult to recover. A poor online experience may drive a prospective consumer away permanently.</description>

      <description>The mission was clear. Our client needed a site to feature a full length documentary with zero down time. We implemented a lightning fast content delivery network to deliver the film behind a password protected gate.
To highlight the film, we included the full press kit, and interactive cast carousel, and an automated email system for the contact film. It was a pleasure working with the director and we were able to go from launch the site in under a week for $400.</description>
