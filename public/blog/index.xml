      <description>Intro If you want to make more sales on your website, one of the key things to focus on is easy navigation. Your potential customers should be able to find what they&amp;rsquo;re looking for quickly and easily, without getting frustrated.

Once you&amp;rsquo;ve lost a client, it&amp;rsquo;s difficult to recover. A poor online experience may drive a prospective consumer away permanently.</description>
