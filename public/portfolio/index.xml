      <description>The mission was clear. Our client needed a site to feature a full length documentary with zero down time. We implemented a lightning fast content delivery network to deliver the film behind a password protected gate.
To highlight the film, we included the full press kit, and interactive cast carousel, and an automated email system for the contact film. It was a pleasure working with the director and we were able to go from launch the site in under a week for $400.</description>
