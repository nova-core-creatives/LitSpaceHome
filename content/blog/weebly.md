### Intro

Weebly is a platform that is often used for web design. However, it lacks the freedom and flexibility you need to create modern user interfaces. If you're looking to create a beautiful and professional website, you should consider using a different platform.  There are many great options available, so there's no need to stick with Weebly.

We will mainly focus on the benefits of WordPress, which can sound outdated but is actually the front runner on the internet. To date, over 60% of all websites are built with WordPress, no matter how much hype there is around some other platforms. It's free and can cost significantly less to host than other DIY site builders.

### WordPress Vs. Weebly


WordPress is a much more flexible and powerful platform than Weebly. It gives you the ability to create custom themes and plugins, which can make your website look and function however you want. WordPress is also open source, so there's a huge community of developers who are always creating new features and improving the software.

Weebly, on the other hand, is a closed platform. This means that you're limited to using the features that they provide. If you want to add any customizations, you'll need to hire a developer to do it for you.

Another big advantage of WordPress is that it's FREE. You can download the software and use it to create your website without paying a dime. Weebly, on the other hand, charges you a monthly fee to use their platform.

Finally, WordPress is much easier to use than Weebly. The interface is more intuitive and user-friendly. Even if you're not a technical person, you should be able to figure out how to use WordPress with ease.

If you're looking to create a professional website, we highly recommend using WordPress instead of Weebly. It's more flexible, powerful, and easy to use. Plus, it's free!


### Not as professional

If you're looking to create a website that looks professional and modern, then you should stop using Weebly and start using WordPress.  Weebly is an outdated platform that doesn't offer the same features and customization options as WordPress. Additionally, Weebly's designs are not as up-to-date as those on WordPress. If you want to create a website that looks great and is easy to use, then WordPress is the platform for you.

I don't want to completely deny the benefits of Weebly though. Since they were bought out by Square, the payment platform, it has become a powerful tool for brick and mortar stores to automate online orders. In that way, we give credit where it is due. We have just seen many clients come through that built their site with them, and can't seem to get their site to look right. It is possible to make a nice-looking site, but on your own can be a daunting challenge without custom code blocks and CSS. All that to say, you might as well use a more flexible platform, or build a site out of HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

### Weeblys Backend

Weebly is also very limiting in terms of customization. You can't customize the code, and you don't have as much control over the look and feel of your website. This can make it difficult to create a website that looks unique and fits your brand. Additionally, Weebly doesn't offer as many templates as other platforms, so you may have to settle for a design that doesn't perfectly match your vision.

They also lost the ability to import templates and styles, and won't allow you to edit the backend code like they used to. This is extremely limiting in terms of flexibility. Shopify, for example, although geared towards e-commerce, has upgraded its stack significantly to keep up.

We won't dive too deep, but if you are interested, they released the Hydrogen Stack. A specifically for advancing their platform in likeness to the ever-popular React of Facebook.

On Shopify or Wordpress, you can import themes that are not available on their marketplace which gives you a lot of freedom for the design of your site, where as you basically need to build a custom site from scratch with Weebly.

### Wordpress is Free

Weebly is not free. If you want to use your own domain name, you need to sign up for a paid plan. Plans start at $5 per month, but if you want to remove Weebly branding from your website, you need to sign up for the $10 per month plan. Additionally, if you want to use e-commerce features, you need to sign up for the $25 per month plan.

In comparison, WordPress is completely free. You can use any domain name you want, and there are no restrictions on customization or features. If you want to use e-commerce features, you can install a free plugin like WooCommerce.

You do need to pay for hosting, which is what you will find if you go to their site. However, if you find a good hosting provider, they will have WordPress pre-installed on your server.  As it happens, that is exactly what we offer, and we'll even set up the base site as per your needs.

### Tutorials

When you use WordPress, you are not alone. There are millions of people using WordPress, and there is a huge community of developers and designers who are willing to help you with any problems you have.

If you need help, you can search the WordPress Codex, which is a database of documentation for WordPress. Alternatively, you can search Google for tutorials on how to do anything you want to do with WordPress. And if all else fails, you can ask for help in the WordPress support forums.

In contrast, Weebly does not have as many resources available to help users. They d do have a support forum, but it is not as active as the WordPress support forums. Additionally, WordPress has its thriving Stack Exchange where questions are actually answered. Whereas, we've seen one too many questions left unanswered on its competitor's forum.

### Conclusion

In conclusion, Weebly is not the best platform for web design. It is limiting in terms of customization and features, and it is not as well supported as WordPress. If you are looking to create a website, you should consider using WordPress instead.  It is more flexible, more powerful, and more supported. Plus, it's free!
