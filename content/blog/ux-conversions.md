When someone comes to your website, they may have a variety of intentions. Your goal is to anticipate what that might be in order to provide them with the best possible experience. Then you must deliver it, and fast. Online attention spans are short, if not gone entirely. If visitors aren't ecstatic right away, they'll go somewhere else online.

Once you've lost a client, it's difficult to recover. A poor online experience may drive a prospective consumer away permanently. After all, there's always another link to click. Not only can providing underwhelming online experience harm your company's reputation, but it can also damage your brand's reputation offline as well. This is why it is critical to optimize your website for the best user experience. Some of the ways you can do this are by ensuring that your website is easy to navigate

That's a major job, but there is some good news. There is a lot of information on the subject of UX design. There's a lot of wonderful research on UX and conversion rates available. It's apparent that both of these factors are linked. Continue reading to learn how to improve conversions using user experience design.

### Definition of UX Design

UX design is the process of creating and designing websites with the user experience in mind. A skilled UX designer anticipates how visitors will interact with the website and tailors the experience accordingly. They focus on user-friendly design, accessibility, and even enjoyment. While some designers may be more concerned with aesthetics and branding, UX designers are more concerned with creating features that improve user experiences and guide visitors through the sales funnel.

### How do You Know Your Page is UX Optimized?

Look for the following characteristics on UX-optimized pages:

- It's simple to use across a variety of browsers and devices.
- Provides visitors with the information they are looking for.
- Everyone who comes to see it is welcome.
- When users enter relevant keywords, it becomes searchable.
- Good design and accurate content help to establish credibility.
- It appears to be attractive to the eye.

### Defining Conversions

Before you can learn how to use UX design to boost conversions, you must first define what a conversion means to you. A sale, of course, is a conversion, but other actions can be as well. These might include:

- Subscribing to Your Email Newsletter
- Obtaining a Whitepaper
- Signing up for a Free Trial
- Filling Out a Contact Information Form
- Social shares and video views are even considered conversions or micro-conversions by some.

Conversions can be defined as any action taken on your website that goes beyond passive viewing of page content. It is any action that leads to a sale or moves the user closer to that point.

More than anything else, UX must consider the customer journey. In essence, it is designing the experience on your website to make that journey a better experience.

### Are User Experience and Conversion Rate Optimization the Same?

The front end, interactive portions of your website are included in UX design. A designer will use the information they have gathered about the target audience, their intentions and preferences, and known behaviors to create a design. Then, using that information, they create and implement designs that are optimized.

Conversion rate optimization usually focuses on a single path in a possible customer journey. A CRO specialist, for example, might work with one landing page to determine why conversions are low by running a battery of tests or reviewing analytics data. It is entirely reasonable for a UX designer and a CRO specialist to collaborate in order to optimize conversions for a specific workflow. This is because the CRO will often need to understand how design is impacting the conversion rates they are trying to optimize

### What Makes Up Good UX Design

A good user experience design will have a different look and feel for each page depending on the brand and target audience. Nonetheless, there are some best practices that can be applied to almost any situation. They are as follows:


### Responsive or Mobile-Friendly Design

You simply cannot claim to have created a good onsite experience if your website does not function properly on any mobile device. Creating the best UX for your mobile users should be a top priority. It's a problem if your content and images don't load properly on a mobile screen, or if users have to struggle to navigate your content.



### Easy-to-Consume Relevant Content

When someone visits your website, they should be able to quickly navigate to the content they require. After that, the content you present should be relevant, useful, and consumable.

What does this imply? Begin with well-written content that includes information that you know your audience requires. Next, add visuals to your content to make it more appealing. Videos, [infographics](https://infogram.com/page/infographic), images, and photographs will be used in high-quality online content that engages readers and keeps them moving through the sales funnel.

Finally, think about readability. Much of this will be taken care of if you're already designing a mobile-friendly experience, but here are a few pointers:

- To break up your text, use white space, numbered lists, and bullet points.
- Shorten your sentences.
- Make use of headings and subheadings.
- Avoid using technical jargon and buzzwords.
- To back up your assertions, provide a link to relevant resources.
- Aim for an eighth-grade reading level or use [Readable](https://readable.com/)

### An Optimized Checkout Process

There is no better place to concentrate on conversions than where customers are converting. This is why your checkout process must be designed to provide a positive user experience. Begin by addressing the needs and concerns of the user:

- Use trust badges to show users that your site has been verified as safe and secure. Provide a variety of payment options so that your users can select the one that best suits their needs.
- Allow guests to check out.
- Reduce the length of forms and collect only the information required to complete the transaction.
- If users leave, re-engage them with a special offer.

### Contact Information

Millennials and members of Generation Z want to know about the brands with which they do business. They want to know if you share their values or if your story touches them in some way. Your website should include information about your company's history as well as the values you stand for.

Following that, ensure that your visitors can contact you. Make sure your contact information is easily accessible regardless of where your visitors are on your website.

Finally, enhance the user experience by making it as simple as possible to obtain assistance. Consider adding help text and messages to your site to assist users as they navigate it. In order to provide real-time assistance, include a live chat option.

### Conclusion

Improve your user experience, and your audience will be more likely to complete the conversion steps. They are much more likely to progress through the sales funnel if their experience on your site is helpful, intuitive, and relevant.
